# LAUNCHBOX

Launchbox brings users together to experience the future of space exploration. With new aerospaces ventures like Elon Musk’s SpaceX -- rockets are becoming a part of our everyday life. Up till now, we’ve had to view launches on youtube or on the nightly news. **Launchbox** changes all that. Our app can help users find upcoming launches all over the world. 

Our unique app allows users to share their excitement about space and technology on Twitter where they can plan meet-ups or invite friends to join a viewing party. 

Check out our deployed app on Heroku! [link to LaunchBox!](http://google.com)

**LaunchBox** is a single-page React application that utilizes a Node server, node packages such as: react-boostrap and react-twitter-widgets, MongoDB with the node package "Mongoose" and Auth0 for authentication. 

We made use of the **LaunchLibrary** API [found here!](https://launchlibrary.net/)
